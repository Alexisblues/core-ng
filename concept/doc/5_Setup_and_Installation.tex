\subsection{Accessible ports from internet}
To offer the endpoints to internet-based transmitters and users, the following port have to be accessible:

\begin{tabular}{r|r|l}
Type & Port & Application\\
\hline
TCP & 80 & HTTP Webinterface and Websocket\\
TCP & 443 & HTTPS Webinterface  and Websocket\\
TCP & 5672 & RabbitMQ Client connection\\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Load balancing and high availability}
\textbf{Internet-based}\\
To offer load balancing and high availability, the internet-based DNS record \textit{hampager.de} would use DNS round-robin with the static internet IPs of the Hamcloud instances.

\textbf{HAMNET/Hamcloud-based}\\
The Hamcloud instances would offer an anycast IP to for transmitter and user connections. There is a special subnet of 44.0.0.0/8 IPs designated for this anycast approach. Besides, the Hamcloud DAPNET instances will have unicast IPs for administration and their inter-node-synchronization.
To connect other nodes besides from the three hamcloud instances, the endpoint to be attached will also be distributed via anycast for maximal fail-over capability.
