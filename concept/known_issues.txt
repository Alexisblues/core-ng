Known Issues from testing
# Galera Cluster need full mesh connectivity

# Recovery is only done, if full mesh connectivity is reestablished. Tested with iptables.
-> Not useful for HAMNET deployment.


# MQTT broker with mosquitto are not loop tolerant
As soon as there is a loop in a mosquitto server bridge setup, messages loop until infinity.
-> Not useful for mesh deployment. Not even ring of full mesh structure in hamcloud possible.
-> Only way is top-down without interconnects
